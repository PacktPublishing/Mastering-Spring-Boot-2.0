# Mastering Spring Boot 2.0
This is the code repository for [Mastering Spring Boot 2.0](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-spring-boot-20?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787127562), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Spring is one of the best frameworks on the market for developing web, enterprise, and cloud ready software. Spring Boot simplifies the building of complex software dramatically by reducing the amount of boilerplate code, and by providing production-ready features and a simple deployment model.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
@RestController
class HelloController {
  @GetMapping("/")
  String hello() {
    "Hello World!!!"
  }
}
```

This book can be read without a computer or laptop at hand, in which case you need nothing more than the book itself. However, to follow the examples in the book, you need Java 8, which you can download from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html, and you will also need your favorite IDE. I have used the Software Spring Tool Suite; download the latest version of Spring Tool Suite (STS) from https://spring.io/tools/sts/all according to your OS. Java 8 and STS work on a variety of platformsâ€”Windows, macOS, and Linux.
